# Dribbble Clone

## Overview
This project is a **Dribbble clone** created to mimic the core design and functionality of the Dribbble platform. It is tailored exclusively for **desktop users**, providing a sleek and modern experience for larger screens.

**Note:** This project is intentionally **not responsive** and does not adapt to mobile or tablet devices.

- **Desktop-Only Experience:** Focused on providing a seamless experience for desktop users.

## Tools & Technologies
